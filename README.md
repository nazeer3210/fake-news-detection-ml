# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

---

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using classical machine learning

and natural language processing techniques.



## Dataset

\- Labeled news articles (REAL / FAKE)

\- Text-based content only



## Techniques Used

\- TF-IDF (unigrams + bigrams)

\- Logistic Regression

\- Naive Bayes

\- SVM

\- Decision Tree

\- Random Forest

\- XGBoost



## Evaluation Metrics

\- Accuracy

\- Precision

\- Recall

\- F1 Score

\- ROC AUC



## Results

Logistic Regression and SVM achieved the best performance with ROC AUC close to 0.98.



## How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run cells sequentially.
